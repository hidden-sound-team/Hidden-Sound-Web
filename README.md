# About
Hidden Sound was a project for CSE 480 - Senior Design Project at Oakland University. 

In the age of ever increasing online transactions, security has become a major concern. User credentials are vulnerable. The theft of a user’s credentials can have serious consequences. Many users have saved their purchasing information, such as credit cards and bank accounts, onto e-commerce sites, like Amazon or Newegg. Due to this, once someone has access to a user’s account, he or she can very easily make purchases at the expense of the user. 

This is where Hidden Sound comes in. Hidden Sound provides a service to third parties wishing to implement 2 Factor Authentication on their websites. With Hidden Sound, before a user can checkout on an e-commerce site, he or she will be shown a QR code. The user will have to scan this QR with our mobile app and authorize the purchase before continuing. A purchase can only be authorized through the mobile device that is linked to that user’s account. This guarantees that only that user can make purchases. In the case of an account breach, the hacker will not be able to purchase anything due to not having the user’s mobile device. With Hidden Sound, you shop with security.
